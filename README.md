# **Superhero Class - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Example**  

## **Description**  
This Python program demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using a **Superhero** class. It includes attributes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance to bring superheroes to life!  

## **Features**  
✅ **Superhero Base Class** → Attributes like name, alias, power, and strength level  
✅ **Encapsulation** → Uses private attributes with getter/setter methods  
✅ **Inheritance** → `FlyingSuperhero` class extends `Superhero` with a flight ability  
✅ **Polymorphism** → Methods behave differently for the base and derived class  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Create a superhero object** with attributes like name, alias, power, and strength.  
2. **Call methods** to introduce the superhero and check their strength level.  
3. **Use encapsulation** to protect and modify the strength level.  
4. **Demonstrate inheritance** by adding a flying superhero with flight speed.  

## **Example Output**  
```
I am Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne. My power is Martial Arts & Intelligence!
Batman's strength level is 90.
I am Superman, also known as Clark Kent. My power is Super Strength & Flight!
Superman is flying at 500 mph!
Superman's strength level is 100.
Batman's strength level is 95.
```

## **Usage**  
1. Save the script as `superhero.py`.  
2. Run the script using:  
   ```sh
   python superhero.py
   ```
3. Observe superhero interactions and modifications.
